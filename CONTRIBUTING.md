# Contributing to Skulk

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Skulk! Skulk is maintained by [Foxlight Foundation](https://github.com/foxlight-foundation) and forked from [exo](https://github.com/exo-explore/exo).

## Getting Started

To run Skulk from source:

**Prerequisites:**
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (for Python dependency management)
  ```bash
  brew install uv
  ```
- [macmon](https://github.com/vladkens/macmon) (for hardware monitoring on Apple Silicon)
  ```bash
  brew install macmon
  ```
- [node](https://github.com/nodejs/node) (for building the dashboard)
  ```bash
  brew install node
  ```
- [rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup) (to build Rust bindings, nightly for now)
  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  rustup toolchain install nightly
  ```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/foxlight-foundation/Skulk.git
cd Skulk/dashboard-react && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
uv sync
uv run exo
```

## Project Structure

Skulk is built with a mix of Rust, Python, TypeScript (React for the dashboard), and the codebase is actively evolving.

### Key directories:
- `src/exo/` — Python backend (inference, API, store, worker, routing)
- `dashboard-react/` — React dashboard (Skulk UI)
- `dashboard/` — Legacy Svelte dashboard (upstream EXO)
- `rust/` — Rust components (networking, libp2p, PyO3 bindings)
- `resources/inference_model_cards/` — Model metadata TOML files
- `docs/` — Technical documentation

### Dashboard (React)

The Skulk dashboard is a React + TypeScript + styled-components app in `dashboard-react/`. Key areas:

- `src/components/pages/` — Top-level views (ChatView, DownloadsPage/ModelStore)
- `src/components/cluster/` — ClusterCard, PlacementManager, RunningInstanceCard
- `src/components/layout/` — HeaderNav, SettingsPanel, InstancePanel, ConversationPanel, StoreRegistryTable
- `src/components/chat/` — ChatForm, ChatMessages, ChatModelSelector
- `src/stores/` — Zustand stores (chatStore, uiStore) with localStorage/sessionStorage persistence
- `src/hooks/` — useClusterState, useConfig, useModelPicker

To run the dashboard in dev mode:
```bash
cd dashboard-react && npm run dev
```
This starts a Vite dev server on port 3000 with hot reload. The dev server proxies API calls to `http://localhost:52415` (the Skulk backend).

### Backend

- `src/exo/api/main.py` — FastAPI server (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama API compatibility)
- `src/exo/master/` — Master node (placement, election, event sourcing)
- `src/exo/worker/` — Worker node (inference, runner management, download coordination)
- `src/exo/store/` — Model store (registry, downloads, config, model optimizer)
- `src/exo/shared/` — Shared types, constants, topology

## Development Guidelines

Before starting work:

- Pull the latest source to ensure you're working with the most recent code
- Keep your changes focused — implement one feature or fix per pull request
- Avoid combining unrelated changes, even if they seem small

This makes reviews faster and helps us maintain code quality as the project evolves.

## Code Style

Write pure functions where possible. Leverage the type systems available to you — Rust's type system, Python type hints, and TypeScript types. Comments should explain why you're doing something, not what the code does — especially for non-obvious decisions.

Run `nix fmt` to auto-format your code before submitting.

For the React dashboard:
- Use styled-components for styling (no CSS modules or Tailwind)
- Use Zustand for state management (not Redux or Context)
- Use individual selectors from stores to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Follow the existing component patterns (styled components at top, component function at bottom)

## Model Cards

Skulk uses TOML-based model cards to define model metadata and capabilities. Model cards are stored in:
- `resources/inference_model_cards/` for text generation models
- `resources/image_model_cards/` for image generation models
- `~/.exo/custom_model_cards/` for user-added custom models

### Adding a Model Card

To add a new model, create a TOML file with the following structure:

```toml
model_id = "mlx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit"
n_layers = 16
hidden_size = 2048
supports_tensor = true
tasks = ["TextGeneration"]
family = "llama"
quantization = "4bit"
base_model = "Llama 3.2 1B"
capabilities = ["text"]
context_length = 131072

[storage_size]
in_bytes = 729808896
```

### Required Fields

- `model_id`: Hugging Face model identifier
- `n_layers`: Number of transformer layers
- `hidden_size`: Hidden dimension size
- `supports_tensor`: Whether the model supports tensor parallelism
- `tasks`: List of supported tasks (`TextGeneration`, `TextToImage`, `ImageToImage`)
- `family`: Model family (e.g., "llama", "deepseek", "qwen")
- `quantization`: Quantization level (e.g., "4bit", "8bit", "bf16")
- `base_model`: Human-readable base model name
- `capabilities`: List of capabilities (e.g., `["text"]`, `["text", "thinking"]`)

### Optional Fields

- `context_length`: Maximum context window size in tokens (derived from `max_position_embeddings` in config.json)
- `components`: For multi-component models (like image models with separate text encoders and transformers)
- `uses_cfg`: Whether the model uses classifier-free guidance (for image models)
- `trust_remote_code`: Whether to allow remote code execution (defaults to `false` for security)

### Capabilities

The `capabilities` field defines what the model can do:
- `text`: Standard text generation
- `thinking`: Model supports chain-of-thought reasoning
- `thinking_toggle`: Thinking can be enabled/disabled via `enable_thinking` parameter
- `image_edit`: Model supports image-to-image editing (FLUX.1-Kontext)

### Security Note

By default, `trust_remote_code` is set to `false` for security. Only enable it if the model explicitly requires remote code execution from the Hugging Face hub.

## Configuration

Skulk uses `exo.yaml` for cluster configuration. Key sections:

- `model_store` — Store host, paths, staging, download settings
- `inference` — KV cache backend selection (`default`, `optiq`, `turboquant_adaptive`, etc.)
- `hf_token` — HuggingFace API token

Configuration can be edited directly in `exo.yaml` or through the dashboard Settings panel. Changes made via the dashboard are synced to all nodes automatically via gossipsub.

## API Adapters

Skulk supports multiple API formats through an adapter pattern. Adapters convert API-specific request formats to the internal `TextGenerationTaskParams` format and convert internal token chunks back to API-specific responses.

### Existing Adapters

- `chat_completions.py`: OpenAI Chat Completions API
- `claude.py`: Anthropic Claude Messages API
- `responses.py`: OpenAI Responses API
- `ollama.py`: Ollama API (for OpenWebUI compatibility)

For detailed API documentation, see [docs/api.md](docs/api.md).

## Testing

Skulk relies heavily on manual testing at this point in the project, but this is evolving. Before submitting a change, test both before and after to demonstrate how your change improves behavior. Do the best you can with the hardware you have available — if you need help testing, ask and we'll do our best to assist. Add automated tests where possible.

The React dashboard has Storybook stories for key components:
```bash
cd dashboard-react && npx storybook dev -p 6007
```

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request and follow the PR template
