exo cluster configuration schema — ``exo.yaml``.

Overview
--------
This module defines the Pydantic models for ``exo.yaml``, the optional
cluster-level configuration file for exo.  The file is placed alongside
the project root on **every node** in the cluster.  If the file is absent,
exo behaves identically to the upstream default (zero-config compatibility).

The ``model_store`` section is the first feature gated by this config.  The
design deliberately leaves room for future sections (e.g. networking tuning,
custom inference backends, cluster-level resource policies) without breaking
existing deployments.

Model store design summary
--------------------------
In a standard exo cluster every node independently downloads its assigned
model shard from HuggingFace at inference time.  For a small home cluster
this means:

* Redundant external bandwidth — every node pulls the same files.
* Slow cold starts on large models (30B+).
* Version drift between nodes.
* No offline capability after the first run.

The model store solves this by designating one node as the **store host**.
The store host serves model files to all other nodes over HTTP on the local
network (typically Thunderbolt or 10 GbE).  Worker nodes stage their
assigned shard to node-local storage before MLX loads it.  MLX always
receives a **local filesystem path** — the inference stack is completely
unaware the store exists.

HuggingFace is used as a fallback when a model is not yet in the store (if
``download.allow_hf_fallback`` is ``true``).  For air-gapped deployments set
it to ``false`` to ensure all models come from the store.

Configuration file location
---------------------------
``exo.yaml`` must be placed at the **same relative path on every node** (i.e.
alongside the ``exo`` project root).  Node-specific behaviour is handled via
``node_overrides`` keyed by hostname or node_id rather than per-node files.

Example ``exo.yaml``::

    model_store:
      enabled: true
      store_host: mac-studio-1    # hostname of the node with attached storage
      store_port: 58080
      store_path: /Volumes/ModelStore/models

      download:
        allow_hf_fallback: true

      staging:
        enabled: true
        node_cache_path: ~/.exo/staging
        cleanup_on_deactivate: true

      node_overrides:
        mac-studio-1:
          staging:
            node_cache_path: /Volumes/ModelStore/models  # load directly from store
            cleanup_on_deactivate: false
